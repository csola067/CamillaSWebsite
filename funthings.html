            <h1>Sights to Highlight Throughout the Summer</h1>
            <p>Besides the best highlights of my summer, I worked a lot! I was able to help out vaccination clinics for <a href="https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/index.aspx/" target="_blank">Ottawa Public Health.</td></a> I was able to help out people not be worried about getting a needle and follow safety protocols.</p>
            <p>Another job that I landed was a barista! I always wanted to be a barista, so I got the chance to work at good ol' <a href="https://www.starbucks.ca/" target="_blank">Starbucks.</td></a> The location is crazy, but I love chatting with people and make coffee/tea. </p>
            <p>Anyways, please enjoy photos that I captured throughout the summer!</p>
